👋 Hi, I’m Lev

Application Security Engineer focused on Web & API Security, WAF tuning, and AWS security.

I work with production-grade HTTP/HTTPS traffic analysis, OWASP Top 10 vulnerability validation, and security controls tuning with an emphasis on reducing false positives without weakening protection.

🔍 Core focus areas
- Application Security (Web / API)
- WAF tuning & false positive reduction
- HTTP traffic analysis & request normalization
- OWASP Top 10 validation & remediation guidance
- AWS security (IAM, VPC, logging)

📌 What you’ll find here
- Practical AppSec notes and checklists
- Security write-ups and case-based analysis
- Small tools/scripts for traffic analysis and security automation
- OWASP-focused practical projects and write-ups (safe, educational)

🎯 Current direction
Building a strong portfolio around AppSec engineering, WAF logic, and API abuse detection.
